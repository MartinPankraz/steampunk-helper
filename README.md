## Getting Started 🚀

Setup ABAP Development tools using SAP's [onboarding guide](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/abap-environment-trial-onboarding.html#146ad3ba-8f2e-454b-93f2-0bbd1dc0ae1f).

Choose between ABAP flavours for your integration journey:

- SAP BTP ABAP Environment (aka. [Steampunk](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/abap-environment?region=all&tab=feature))
- SAP S/4HANA Cloud  – ABAP Environment (aka. [Embedded Steampunk](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/10/25/how-to-use-embedded-steampunk-in-sap-s-4hana-cloud-private-edition-and-in-on-premise-the-new-abap-extensibility-guide/))

Get [ABAP SDK for Azure](https://github.com/microsoft/ABAP-SDK-for-Azure) to use out of the box integrations with Azure AD, Microsoft Graph, etc, or scrap for ABAP snippets to use in your own integrations.

Get [Microsoft AI SDK for SAP](https://microsoft.github.io/aisdkforsapabap/) for integration with Azure OpenAI service used in part 2 of the "embedded steampunk" series.
